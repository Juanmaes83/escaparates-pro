V4.1 authoring model:
- explicit SUBIR -> CARGADO -> START -> APPLIED state;
- image/video background with transform controls;
- image/video mapped to simulated cloth;
- cloth opacity, brightness, contrast and saturation;
- dual-video hardening: cloth grading canvas updates only on decoded video frames, never on every WebGPU render tick;
- requestVideoFrameCallback scheduling with capped CPU grading uploads and legacy timer fallback;
- grading working surface capped at 1024 px to reduce CPU/GPU bandwidth;
- cleanup cancels video-frame callback/timer before disposing old media;
- Scale / Position X / Position Y;
- original Experience modes preserved: Prairie Cloth, Autumn Leaves, Sakura Petals;
- additive Experience presets: Museum Cloth, Gallery Wind, Fashion Drapery, Product Reveal;
- original Venus de Milo preserved;
- generated templates preserved: Torus Knot, Abstract Orbit, Museum Plinth;
- real local CC0 templates from Khronos glTF Sample Assets: Corset mannequin, Lantern, BoomBox;
- uploaded GLB/GLTF/OBJ object support;
- replacement geometry rebuilds the real BVH cloth collider;
- PNG, WebM and clean preview.

Banderolas Dinamicas remains untouched and is not a runtime dependency.
Its proven media-state pattern plus Infinite Worlds V1.3.1 direct video-resource pattern informed V4.1.
