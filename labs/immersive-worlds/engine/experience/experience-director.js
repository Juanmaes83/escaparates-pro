/**
 * Immersive Worlds — Experience Director
 *
 * Guided Experience: chapters, story steps, shots and cues.
 *
 * Two contracts matter more than any feature here:
 *
 *   1. The Director *orchestrates*; it does not own subsystem internals
 *      (IW-ADR-007). It never writes the camera, never builds a Space, never
 *      touches a material. It asks, through the ports below.
 *
 *   2. Explore and Guided drive the SAME World State (IW-ADR-003). There is no
 *      "guided copy" of the world: a work focused during the tour is in the
 *      visitor's visited set afterwards, and a portal traversed by the tour is
 *      the same traversal the visitor could have made on foot.
 *
 * Transport is deliberately thin — play, pause, resume, skip, exit. A seekable
 * authored timeline is SHOULD LATER (Constitution §16) and is not built here.
 *
 * No Three.js. No DOM.
