/**
 * Immersive Worlds — Crossing camera controller
 *
 * The camera while the visitor moves from one room to another. This is the
 * mechanism behind `CAMERA_AUTHORITY.TRANSITION`: for the length of a crossing
 * it is the single authoritative writer, so neither the outgoing Directed shot
 * nor the incoming Explore controller touches the camera while a doorway is
 * being passed. One writer, one continuous move, one room handoff.
 *
 * What it is not: a portal renderer. The Museum's rooms are genuinely adjacent
 * in one scene and the destination is already visible through the opening, so
 * there is nothing to project — the crossing is a *move*, and the only thing
 * this file knows how to do is move a camera well.
 *
 * Three legs on one clock:
 *
 *   APPROACH   square up to the aperture and aim through it
 *   THRESHOLD  pass exactly through the gate point; the room hands off here
 *   ARRIVAL    settle onto the pose the beat was authored to end on
 *
 * The endpoint is not negotiable. Every shaping term below — the bend, the
 * target lead, the aperture pin, the fov breath — is zero at k=1 by
 * construction, so the crossing can only choose *how* the camera arrives.
 *
 * No graphics library here. The pose is plain numbers.
