/**
 * Museum Scene Kit — visual profiles
 *
 * The same semantic Space data is realized differently depending on its
 * `sceneProfile`. This file is the proof of Constitution §30: three profiles on
 * one architecture, not three museums.
 *
 * Art direction notes (Unslop §24 — these are choices, not defaults):
 *   • Surfaces are warm neutrals, never pure #ffffff or #000000. A gallery wall
 *     is plaster, and plaster has a temperature.
 *   • Light has a direction and a hierarchy: the works are the brightest thing
 *     in the room, and the wall between them falls away. "Identical lighting
 *     everywhere" is on the reject list.
 *   • No emissive accent colour anywhere. The only saturated colour in the
 *     rooms is the art itself.
 *
 * Intensities are tuned for three.js physical lighting: spot values are
 * candela and fall off with distance, so they are small numbers next to the
 * hemisphere fill, which is not distance-based. They were set by looking at
 * captures, not by guessing — see qa/ evidence.
